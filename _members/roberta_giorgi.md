description: "Roberta obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Bioinformatics from Sapienza University of Rome. Her thesis focused on molecular docking studies.  Subsequently, she completed a Master’s degree in Data Science (also at Sapienza University of Rome) focusing on data analysis, machine learning, and, in particular, deep learning algorithms. Her thesis aimed to shed light on the explainability of graph neural networks trained for molecular docking, trying to mitigate the unreliability of existing protein-ligand interaction datasets.
