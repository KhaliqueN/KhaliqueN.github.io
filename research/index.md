### Understanding how alternative splicing (AS) perturbs protein complexes

AS results in multiple protein isoforms from a single gene.
Proteins function by physically interacting with each other to form protein complexes.
Hence, the effects of AS on individual proteins could also be reflected on protein complex formation.
Investigations of how AS perturbs protein complex formation could provide insights into AS-driven disease mechanisms and help identify drug targets.
We build computational [**approaches**](https://github.com/lieboldj/EEIpred) to capture such AS-driven effects on disruptions of know protein complexes in [**diseases**](https://github.com/KhaliqueN/Cancer_prognostic_EEIs).

### Understanding transcription factors

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate gene expression based on their 3D structures.
Changes in their 3D structures due to molecular processes, e.g., alternative splicing, could lead to gene dysregulation leading to diseases. We build computational [**approaches**](https://github.com/lieboldj/StrucTFactor) to understand TFs and how perturbations of their 3D structures are related to [**diseases**]().
